For each POJO you created to complete the previous Airplane exercise, please change all the instance variables in each
class to "private". Then, create getter and setter methods (for each instance variable) in each class you created for
the airplane exercise. Once complete, demonstrate getting and setting those variables from the class in which you
composed the Airplane object.
